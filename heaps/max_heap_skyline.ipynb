    "## Skyline\n",

    "The skyline of a city is composed of several buildings of various widths and heights, possibly overlapping one another when viewed from a distance. We can represent the buildings using an array of `(left, right, height)` tuples, which tell us where on an imaginary x-axis a building begins and ends, and how tall it is. The skyline itself can be described by a list of (X, height) tuples. X denotes the location at which the height visible to a distant observer changes, and height is the new height observed at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of buildings as described above, create a function that returns the skyline.\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "For each building we have to compare its height with others that overlap with it. This comparison with each building in the list will lead to a O(N2) runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "To speed it up, we can use a max heap. The max heap will hold at all the buildings that overlap with the current building, and ordered by height.\n",
    "\n",
    "First step is to order the buildings using their `left` edge values, and use `height` to break any tie. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each building:\n",
    "- Pop all the elements from the heap whose right edge value don't overlap with the current building \n",
    "- Push the current building onto the heap\n",
    "- if the heap max has a different height than the last one in the skyline, we add (left, heap_max_height) to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note however that we haven't evaluated the ends of each building (i.e, 15, 11, 23). We can include these points as zero-length \"buildings\" before we sort them.\n"
