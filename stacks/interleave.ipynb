    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the stack is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, it should become `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] we want [1, 5, 2, 4, 3].\n",
    "* We can see this is just a pairing of a queue with (5, 4) and a stack of [3, 2, 1] where we first pop off stack and then get from the queue.\n",
    "* At this point, we can get to the above from a queue of (3, 2, 1, 5, 4)\n",
    "* [3, 2, 1, 5, 4] is just a rotation of (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps will look as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the elements from the stack and pop them into the queue. (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\n",
    "2. Rotate half of the queue by looping through half stack-size / 2 times, getting the elements and putting them back in. (1, 2, 3, 5, 4)\n",
    "3. Put ceil(len(stack) / 2) elements into the stack. The queue is now (5, 4) and stack is [3, 2, 1]\n",
    "4. Pair them up len(stack) / 2 times. If stack is still not empty, pop one more time\n",
    "5. Move all elements from the queue to the stack"
